This repository contains machine learning models and analysis code developed to predict human West Nile Virus (WNV) cases based on environmental, climatic, and land-use features across the United States and California.

The project is organized into national-level models (CDC data) and regional models (California-specific data), with additional supplemental materials included.

Project Overview

National Models (national_CDC_code)
• Predicts annual human WNV cases across the U.S. using CDC-reported data.
• Machine learning methods include:
• Random Forest (RF)
• Support Vector Machine (SVM)
• Histogram-Based Gradient Boosting (HGBR)
• Neural Networks
• Subsampling experiments were conducted to address class imbalance.
• State-level models were also built to capture regional differences.

California Regional Models (regional_California_code)
• Focuses on 13 counties in California with detailed monthly WNV case reports.
• Methods include:
• Lagged feature-enriched models: use differencing and lag features to improve predictions.
• Iterative models: predict each month iteratively based on previous months.
• Spatial models: integrate county-level spatial patterns into modeling.
• Models used: SVM, RF, HGBR.
• Feature importance is analyzed using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).

Supplemental Materials (supplemental_materials)
• Contains figures and tables that support the analyses presented in the dissertation.

Data Information
• The national CDC datasets in data_demo/ are randomly generated mock data for demonstration and code testing purposes — not real human WNV case data.
• The California regional datasets (CA_human_data_2004_to_2023_final_all_counties_CDPH_scraped.csv) were scraped from California Department of Public Health West Nile Virus Reports.
• Please note:
The real data used in the dissertation differs from the demo data provided in this repository.

⸻

Main Features
• Automated hyperparameter optimization using Hyperopt.
• Bootstrapping to assess prediction confidence intervals (R² and MSE).
• SHAP-based feature importance at both global and local levels.
• Structured pipelines for training, validation, testing, and evaluation.

⸻

Requirements

Install the required Python packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Major dependencies include:
• pandas
• numpy
• matplotlib
• scikit-learn
• shap
• hyperopt
• torch
• plotly
• seaborn
• xarray
• opencv-python (only required if using OpenCV-based extensions; not essential for core WNV modeling)

Other:
• pathlib (built-in for Python 3.6+)
• stack_data (optional, used in debugging tools)

How to Run

Each script can be run independently.

For example, to run the lagged feature enriched model for California:

python regional_California_code/models/lagged_feature_enriched_model/lagged_feature_enriched_model.py

Outputs (bootstrapping results, shap plots, metrics, etc.) will be saved automatically under the corresponding results/ folders.
